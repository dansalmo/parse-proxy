<br/> 
<br/><b >Product Management and UX
Experience at DivX</b>
<br/>Lead an agile
product team as Director of Product Management for a strategic initiative and
product known as DivX Connected.  Product
owner for multiple scrum teams developing consumer facing software, application
extensions, server software, device firmware, and hardware platforms for a
turnkey production ready home media networking solution.
<br/> 
<br/>Worked closely
with the founders of DivX, reporting directly to Jerome Rota, to ensure the
product was developed in line with the company vision and strategy.  Worked closely with stakeholders and major
OEM customers to define features meeting market and user needs within the time
required.  Effectively leveraged the best
aspects of the agile process to remain aware of the team&#8217;s velocity while
monitoring market changes to make course corrections as needed while delivering
according to CE partners schedule needs.
<br/> 
<br/>Leveraged
engineering and engineering management background in understanding developers
motivations and fears.  Knows the
importance of staying informed of progress and prioritizing effectively when
timing is a firm requirement.  Worked
closely with project managers to obtain and track commitments.  Collaborated with product marketing,
community web team, beta testers and larger DivX community to launch the
product and track how well the product was meeting the needs of the user
community.
<br/> 
<br/>Directed team of
five product managers working on projects and interacting with over forty
engineering and QA team members. 
Inherited and hired product managers and user experience professionals
and assigned roles based on interests and best fit for DivX&#8217;s main stream consumer
software products.  Effectively mentored
junior team members into more senior roles. 
Lead strategic direction of main software products away from the
addition of larger, more complex features and towards ease of use and ecosystem
exposure resulting in a product with higher user engagement, improved usability
and greater user comprehension of the DivX ecosystem.  Innovated new media interaction methods,
created and tested rapid prototypes to demonstrate a new product concepts value
resulting in approval for further development.
<br/>
<br/><b >Built and lead an agile UX
team </b>
<br/>Incorporated
iterative user testing of product concepts and the creation and testing of
rapid hi-fidelity prototypes as part of an agile development process. Testing
concepts and interaction designs early and often prior to committing a large
amount of development resources ensured our products met the needs of our
business and our users.
<br/> 
<br/><b >Agile development process
knowledge and skills</b>
<br/>I have found the Agile
process to be the most effective method for developing complex projects when
either time or feature set are the limiting factors.  Agile development methods promote the growth
of self organizing teams allowing for group knowledge to emerge and be acted
upon in an efficient manner.  Complex
projects requiring creation of new technology are a domain where group knowledge
of current progress velocity, potential roadblocks and the best path to
completion is superior to any individual team member&#8217;s knowledge and vastly superior
to any individual program or product manager&#8217;s knowledge.  The self organizing nature of a properly structured
and practiced agile team will lead to a higher degree of team success and
confidence in a surprisingly short time after team formation.  Iterative development is another valuable tool
of the agile process allowing real and not just perceived problems to be surfaced
and dealt with earlier and more effectively.
